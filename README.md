# DataStructure-Project-4
 
This project is worth 150 points.
 
Project on time due date: Tuesday, December 6 at 11pm.
Bonus due date (15 points): Monday, December 5 at 11pm.
 
 
Basic Rubric

Your project will be graded as follows:
The total for the project is 150 points (15% of the semester grade).
15 points will be auto-graded by Web-CAT using checkstyle.
75 points will be auto-graded by Web-CAT for passing test cases.
* The actual number of points that you get are found by multiplying the points for the test cases passed by the percent of your own test cases passed by the percent of lines covered by your own tests.
60 points will be awarded by the human grader.
* Those points are based on quality of the design and completeness of the implementation (don't expect to get all of the TA-awarded points if you only do half the project).
* 10 points out of this pool of 60 points are awarded for successfully passing the three mini-milestones defined below. For each milestone that you pass, you will get 5 points (for a maximum of 10 points).
* There is also a 15 point bonus for turning the project in by the early due date. So the maximum points possible is actually 165.
 
Milestones
 
Milestone 1: Due by Thursday, November 17 at 11pm
* Pass 2 Web-CAT reference tests.
One of the auto-grader's reference tests is passed simply by submitting something that has the right class name (GraphProject), this is worth no correctness points. The other can be passed by implementing the connection between the memory manager and the buffer pool.
 
Milestone 2: Due by Monday, November 28 at 11pm
* Pass 5 Web-CAT reference tests.
* Have 90% code coverage from your own JUnit tests with NONE of your own tests failed
* Have at least 1 point for style
In practice, this means that you have completed integration of the memory manager and the buffer pool.
 
Milestone 3: Due by Thursday, December 1 at 11pm
* Pass 7 Web-CAT tests
* Have 90% code coverage from your own JUnit tests with NONE of your own tests failed
* Have at least 5 points for style
In practice, this means that you have some of the basic graph functionality completed.
